# Analysis of Walmart Sales Data

Tools used: Power BI (DAX), SQL, and Python.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data

In addition to the temporal revenue trends visualized by line charts and the aggregated metrics by column charts, my PBI report can be used to draw deeper insights such as:

- The categories, departments, and individual items that contributed most to a month-to-month increase or decrease in revenue, both visually and quantitatively.
- Week-to-week revenue changes that examines the revenue generated during the week of notable events (e.g., holidays, sporting events, etc.) and compare them with neighboring weeks. Revenue changes are quantitatively broken down by categories, departments, and individual items.
- Generally, days that SNAP (food assistance) benefits are distributed see higher average daily sales than non-SNAP days. These differences are visualized and quantified across states and stores. Furthermore, the (percentage) breakdown of SNAP revenue and non-SNAP revenue by category, department, and item can be compared quantitatively.
  - In relation, revenue trends aggregated at the weekly level show pretty consistent spikes at the first two weeks of each month, which coincide with the part of the month when SNAP benefits are distributed.
- Time intelligence functions were applied throughout my report to compare revenue and revenue breakdown (including percentages) over week-to-week, month-to-month, and year-to-year time periods.

The insights that my report provides can be used to guide decisions on inventory, promotions, ads, and marketing. The following sections describe a few detailed examples of how insights can be generated from my report.
